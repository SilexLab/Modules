Silex Modules
-------------

Basic Silex Modules for building own Modules from or adding basic functions to Silex.
Each Module has its own directory and is installed by the Silex Module Installer after being archived to a .tar file.
The information from `module.xml` will be written to the Silex DB for later use, e.g. when deinstalling the module.
